# Rjali-Romance

Rjali NPC MOD is a romance add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II Extended Edition, with the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. Thanx to @Austin87, as of v12.0, this mod is now EET compatible.

Rjali is an amorous cleric/thief who will not leave your side. You just cannot get rid of her. She will accept your other amours as long as you take good care of her. Primary interests: romance and the search for the perfect taco. She is strictly a one man woman, and you are that man. She refuses to have anything to do with evil PCs. If your PC changes gender, she will return you to being male which is, of course, her preference. If your PC becomes evil, Rjali will leave you permanently.

This mod is intended only for heterosexual, non-evil males. My apologies to all those gamers who are otherwise amorously inclined. I am an old guy with limited tastes. This is not intended as a slight, but as an expression of my own daydreams. As for yours, roll your own with my blessing. So to speak...

The major idea for this mod came when I realized that, while multiple romance was a thing, it was only to be accomodated by everybody being unaware of the situation and going their several ways. Sort of a firewall. It occured to me that it would be interesting if the characters became aware of what was going on and interacted on that basis. I will admit that the scenario is quite limited: non-evil, heterosexual, male PC romancing multiple females. But beyond that scenario, things get WAY more complicated than I can handle. I will leave the generalization to younger, more ambitious developers. This is as far as my imagination and ambition can carry me.
