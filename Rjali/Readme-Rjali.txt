1. Introduction
----------------

Rjali NPC MOD is a romance add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II Extended Edition, with the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. Thanx to @Austin87, as of v12.0, this mod is now EET compatible.

Rjali is an amorous cleric/thief who will not leave your side. You just cannot get rid of her. She will accept your other amours as long as you take good care of her. Primary interests: romance and the search for the perfect taco. She is strictly a one man woman, and you are that man. She refuses to have anything to do with evil PCs. If your PC changes gender, she will return you to being male which is, of course, her preference. If your PC becomes evil, Rjali will leave you permanently.

This mod is intended only for heterosexual, non-evil males. My apologies to all those gamers who are otherwise amorously inclined. I am an old guy with limited tastes. This is not intended as a slight, but as an expression of my own daydreams. As for yours, roll your own with my blessing. So to speak...

The major idea for this mod came when I realized that, while multiple romance was a thing, it was only to be accomodated by everybody being unaware of the situation and going their several ways. Sort of a firewall. It occured to me that it would be interesting if the characters became aware of what was going on and interacted on that basis. I will admit that the scenario is quite limited: non-evil, heterosexual, male PC romancing multiple females. But beyond that scenario, things get WAY more complicated than I can handle. I will leave the generalization to younger, more ambitious developers. This is as far as my imagination and ambition can carry me.

This mod has language support for:
  English
  Russian

2. Installation
----------------

It is not necessary to install the Tweaks Anthology Romance Cheats with option multiple romance allowed, unless you want old style multiple romance for mods not supported (below). Rjali is VERY multiple romance oriented, and attends to these little details herself for supported NPCs.

Install all other romance mods before this mod. Rjali makes changes! Supported mods are:

  - Imoen Romance v4.0.0 (HIGHLY recommended!) (In fact, damned near required!) (In further fact, install this before all other romance mods as the latest release tends to overlay (read: wipe out) the work of those other mods.) - Parkable (long)
  - Sirene_BG2 v1.8.1 (I seem to have a thing for tieflings.) - Parkable (medium)
  - Skie ReDone v3.0 (by request from Seewead) - Parkable (medium)
  - Petsy Chattertone v3.1 (by request from Seewead) - Parkable  (long)
  - Branwen Romance v3 (Here, because this kicked me into gear to do this mod.) - Parkable (short)
  - Yvette Romance v3.0 (A talking portrait. Who wouldn't?) - NOT Parkable
  - Tashia Romance v1.6 (Just 'cause I could.) - Parkable (short)
  - Nalia Romance v6 (Gonna use the Keep, so why not?) - Parkable (long)
  - Tyris Romance v7 (Again, I know. But: ve haf vays of making her stay.) - Parkable (short)
  - Ninde Romance v3.0 (Why not?) - Parkable in ToB
  - DaceEET Romance v3.1 (by request from Ser Elryk) - Parkable (short)
  - Isra Romance v2.1 (by request from Ser Elryk) - Parkable (medium)
  - Saerileth Romance v20 (Yes, I know. But there is a rationale as you will see.) - Parkable in ToB
  - AmberEET Romance v5.1 (by request from Ser Elryk) - Parkable (medium)
  - Sheena Romance v2.6 (A sexy half-dragon? Who wouldn't?) - Parkable (short)
  - Fade Romance v7.3b (I miss Annah from PST.) Install this mod after all the above romance mods; it has a bug that I can fix only if it is last. - Parkable (medium)

I repeat: INSTALL THESE MODS BEFORE RJALI!!! (If you want to play them as multiple romance.) Note that I have listed them in the order that I do my installs. Specifically: the Imoen Romance must be first to ensure that the interjections of other mods occur before Imoen gets her little pattypaws on them; and Sirene is second because it is a relatively new mod with interjections that don't play nice with those from earlier installed mods.

To install the mod, unpack the archive into your BG2 directory and run
Setup-Rjali.exe.

Once you see the Readme, the installation is complete.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Rjali.exe in your game directory.

Your choices:

1) Timing Adjustments

  - If not installed, the original NPC timings obtain.
  - If any of the three options are selected, Horace's ability to expedite parking will be installed.
  - In addition, if option 2 or 3 is selected, other romance mod timings will be speeded up.

2) The Rjali Mod Itself

  - If you do not install this, I don't want to know about you. Go away and enjoy some other mod.
  - Installed, everything comes into play, except for the last option to equip the troops. If Rjali rejects you (female and/or evil) or if you reject Rjali (you get one shot at this in your introductory dialogue), the lamp will still be there and function as such even though Horace will not chat with you beyond the introduction, and the orphanage project and PST content are lost (of course); Rjali cannot equip you per the last option, but the equipment will be available through Horace pretty much as if you used CLUAConsole to CreateItem; the talk/flirt timings will still be as you requested in the first option; group banters will still be in play; and multiple romances will still go forward if you have installed the cdttweaks multiple romance option (which is not required if the Rjali Mod is installed), without the coordination of course.

3) Rjali equips the troops

  - This option is only available if the Rjali Mod is installed.
  - If installed, Rjali will give each joining NPC some really powerful equipment which will automatically be placed in appropriate slots (destroying anything that happens to already be in those slots while protecting against replacing an NPC's critical items), as long as she is still with you. Horace will dispense equipment on request anyway, sort of like an in-game CLUAConsole. Note that weapons are not equipped, requiring you to do this manually.
  - All advanced AI scripts will be replaced with AGEN. This is to prevent destructive interruption of dialogues.
  - Spell slots will be maximized for all creatures who can spell. This will take place the first time a character advances a level.
  - The default AI script is set to AGEN for everyone joining the party. It is recommended that you also set your protagonist's AI script to AGEN. The Advanced AI scripts will not be available.
  - If you enjoy struggle (especially in combat) in your game, DO NOT INSTALL THIS COMPONENT. And avoid asking Horace for items and services, or use the dialogue option to turn them off.

For MAC OS X:

There is a weidu-mac executable provided. You have two options. Pick whichever you prefer.

    Copying Option.
        Copy weidu-mac over Setup-Rjali.exe.
        Run Setup-Rjali.exe (you may have to type ./Setup-Rjali.exe to do so)
    Hand-Installation Option.
        Run weidu-mac Setup-Rjali.tp2 --tlkout dialog.tlk

3. General Information
-----------------------

This mod adds Rjali as a viable, fully developed NPC.

Rjali introduces herself in Chateau Irenicus right at the start.

She has a full romance with the PC, player/NPC-initiated flirts, banters with other NPCs, a number of interjections, character reactions and other scenery dialogue. Adult content. The romance pairing actually starts when she joins.

In addition to the romance mods listed above, Rjali takes into account romances with Aerie, Jaheira, Viconia, and Neera. I play with Rjali, Imoen, and three of the other romanceable female NPCs, depending on my mood. Or I did until Annah, Grace, Ravel, and Kesai-Serris came along. I am currently rethinking my options...

You run into an old *friend* from the Sword Coast. Jini the Djinni has taken up residence in Sigil where you meet her once again. You are left with the fallout from PST and, with the proper attitude and preparation, one or more of Annah, Grace, and Ravel might be induced to accompany you on your travels. And, yes, romance IS in the cards. (Q: Ravel?!? A: Wait for it. And you thought Rjali was single minded!) Kesai-Serris makes a brazen offer to accompany you. Oh, yes. Fay the Will-O-The-Wisp also carries over from the Sword Coast days (cf: Jini mod for BGEE).

After the game is over but before credits roll, you have the opportunity to enjoy the fruits of your enormous victory by visiting your keep and wandering around seeing the sights, chatting with people, and visiting Sigil. This gives you the power to terminate the game at your own whim rather than letting the game get away with throwing you out after the climax. (Pun intended...) There are treats in store for you. In order to terminate the game once you are in the expansion section post-game, talk with Rjali outside the gates of the de'Arnise Keep which will trigger THE END!

If you experience any problems with Rjali's select/confirm sounds pre-expansion, select her in the game and press K key. This should fix the problem.

Nota: I just realized something. deArnise = deAR nise = Dear Niece (Nalia). GROOOOOAN!

Nota: I figured out how to dynamically change the destination of an area exit. "Dream Doors" might still be in the cards in a later release, you never know your luck. Gotta get the PST thing out the door first.

Nota: I just found out that [PC] refers to ANY playing character, which is usually of significance only in multi-player games. However, if you are foolish enough to muck about with an NPC and make them LOOK like a PC (which I did), Range([PC]) etc are gonna find them. Made me wonder why a dialog was triggering when my protagonist in a single-player game was far and away.

Nota: BG2EE v2's new ADVANCED AI breaks dialogues, especially for all types of rogue who are forever going into and out of search-for-traps mode. I recommend that you not use it. Unfortunately, it is the default, so you have to manually change it for each member of your party including your PC and any new join/rejoin NPCs. It is set for the PC only after Imoen joins in Chateau Irenicus. If you use the equip option, I replace all the ADVANCED AI default scripts with the AGEN script; this eliminates the possibility of using the ADVANCED AI.

Caveat: Playing as rapidly as I do, I have found that I need to be careful and slow down in certain situations. When characters are leaving an area, you need to wait until they have completely gone before exitting the area. When you might be getting a messenger (deArnise Keep plot/playhouse plot/magehold plot/etc...), slow down and keep your eye out for approaching characters. Failing to do these two things can break elements of the game. This is NOT caused by any mod, but is inherent in the basic game itself. Now, if only I could take my own advice. At least, I am getting really, really good at recognising when I have screwed up!

Spoiler: When you turn off Party AI to void killing unnecessarily, it can be a problem keeping Fay with the party, especially if you need to go through a door that requires the whole party. With a dialogue option, you can ask Fay to follow you instead of running away from attackers. She's tough and can survive a fair amount of damage. When the relevant sequence has passed, you can switch her back to her normal cautious mode. Of course, if you find other uses of this facility, feel free to use it. This happens for me in the shark city when I race to meet with the exiled prince and I don't want to fight, yet.

Caveat: The Imoen Romance eschews the use of double scripting to initiate dialogues. This technique is used to assure that a dialogue triggers in the event of a conflict of dialogues. You may need to PID Imoen to check if a dialogue has failed to trigger. Also, if you have moved from Spellhold to Brynnlaw with Imoen and Aerie in your party and the Imoen/Aerie friendship dialogues fail to appear, you should have Imoen initiate a dialogue with Aerie to kick-start that sequence.

Nota: When using the fixpacks, it is recommended that you do NOT activate the "Nothing kills romance" option of the Romance Cheats. This conflicts with Rjali's insistence on curtailing certain romances, and you get a never-ending-loop. I have fixed this for Anomen, Dorn, Hexxat, and Rasaad (always assuming you applied the fixpack before Rjali). The fixpack fix is gender neutral, and Rjali is most definitely NOT! Besides, I have done a runthrough without the fixpack Romance Cheats installed, and everything works just fine without it.

Nota: Yvette will never be parkable, because her status remains uncertain until the very end of ToB. However, with the latest changes, it is just possible to romance ALL the women in one game. The bottleneck is the Brynnlaw/Spellhold/Underdark sequence where your party MUST consist of Rjali (who never leaves), Yvette (who is unparkable), Saerileth (who is unparkable until ToB), Ninde (who is unparkable until ToB), and Yoshimo (in addition to the bit involving his heart, he serves as a placeholder for Imoen whom you pick up in Spellhold). Everybody else needs to be parked before this sequence starts.

Caveat: I really hate ClearAllActions(). It terminates any outstanding actions from scripts and dialogues. It precurses many Cutscenes in the vanilla game and many mods. When conflicts occur, crucial plot elements can be missed. I know. I have had a variable not set because of it in one of my test runthroughs. Bad word. If this happens to you, all you can do is hope you have a savegame sufficiently far back to retry. (I am also not fond of CreateCreatureObjectOffScreen, since it can make encountering a messenger problematic. It has its uses, but introducing messengers ain't one of them.)

Nota: Under some conditions, the game would give me an error message and refuse to start up after I had uninstalled this mod. After chasing my tail, I found that the problem was that I had copied the 00783 game folder which contained a Backup sub-folder that did not reflect the game install status. The solution was to restore 00783 to before installing Rjali, delete the Backup folder, create a new and empty one, and reinstall Rjali. An uninstall at this point works just peachy-keen. Sometimes I am stupidier than other times...

Caveat: I made a mistake and coded SetGlobal("RJPort","GLOBALS",0). Instead of flagging it as an error, the WeiDu compiler attempted a fix and generated SetGlobal("SRJPort","GLOBAL",0). This is not friendly.

Nota: Sometimes when Horace tells you that a party member needs to rest and you sleep, the rest dialogue does not ensue. The dialogue trigger has been set, but the dialogue was pre-empted by some other dialogue. Initiating a dialogue with the party member should trigger the rest dialogue. Sometimes, it's just a timing problem, and you just have to wait for the rest dialogue to occur after a later sleep.

Nota: The four Sigil quests to retrieve Adahn, Morte, Nordom, and Dakkon are chained. Each must be played in the chapter in which it is introduced, or the next in line will not trigger and other developments will be lost. I am always tripping over the Morte quest, myself.

Nota: I have recently upgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 7 SP1 (with no subsequent updates). I find I have far fewer timing problems. It seems that Windows 10 is not only a world leading piece of spyware, but it also is a resource pig of some note. DEFENESTRATE BILL GATES!

Caveat: The TimeOfDay(MORNING) trigger seems not to work.

Other mod bug fixes:

Imoen: Overrides Fade's mod to create the dragon's tooth. Fixed. If you rush through ToB without talking to Imoen A LOT, variables don't get set, and the game-end is broken. I patched this: it ain't great, but at least you can finish the game.

Skie: Setup for Skie epilogues provides an incorrect portrait name. One dialog has EscapeArea() before a variable is set: reversed.

Petsy: Remove Petsy romance race restriction. "RibaldTanel" replaced with "PetsySamuel" in FFBART.dlg (Samuel.d), to properly control sequence of dialogue. Also, Petsy uses fiance and fiancee with an e-acute. Petsy gets snatched by another vamp in the Bodhi sequence, making you lose two (2) party members. This is a problem as there is only one Bodhi's Heart. I kludged this by removing the requirement to use Bodhi's Heart in ressurecting Petsy. Imoen Romance interferes with Petsy epilogues, so I reinserted them without the extra triggers; now, she just has to be in the party. Petsy dialogue is poorly controlled which I patched at the start of Quest2. There may be other such problems. Using incorrect variable in Gorion Wraith sequence.

Dace: Dace spawning in Trademeet all screwed up. Removed it, so you will have to pick her up in Waukeen's Promenade. She approaches you and, if you are quick enough, she will follow you into Ribald's; under some conditions of play, you may avoid her in Ribald's and never be able to converse with her again. Made change to allow you to talk with her inside Ribald's. She also has a problem in Watcher's keep, not doing a chapter differentiation for SoA and ToB interjections. Made change to allow you to converse with her inside or outside of Ribald's. Dace also has a diacritical that needed removing. Epilogues switched from EXTEND_BOTTOM to EXTEND_TOP.

Fade: Her interjections in Watcher's Keep were intended for ToB only but were not gated by chapter. Set a chapter gate AND duplicated the interjections for SoA with the complementary chapter gate. While the Soulfire Gem was created, it was not placed anywhere in the game. It is there now, and you will stumble across it in time.

Amber, Tashia, Tyris, and Ninde: All have a dialogue line with "naive" spelled with an i-umlaut. This blows the game out of the water. Replaced the offending lines with the i-umlaut changed to a regular "i". Amber also spells entree with the e-acute. Listen folks: BG2EE does NOT like accented alphabet characters. CUT IT OUT!

Saerileth: Fix install bug that doesn't properly convert chapter references. Fix variable mistakenly identified as GLOBAL.

Ninde: Fix a bug bottlenecking Ninde's love talks in the Underdark.

Sirene: Flirts missing default dialogue transition.

Sheena: ToB dialog/script file names too large.

BG2 Tweakpack Multiple Romances: Does not handle the post Gorion Wraith sequence properly, except for the NPC who was subjected to the wraith's scrutiny. Fixed. Note that Tweak Anthology has the same problem and the same fix.

BG2 Tweakpack Multiple Strongholds: Cleric not spawning. Fixed. Note that Tweak Anthology has fixed this problem.

BG2 Journal: Journal entries are not being logged. I recommend that you get and install EEUITweaks v2.6, selecting the Record/Inventory/Journal Group and, under that, the lefreut's Simple Journal Fixes. This was fixed by Beamdog in v2.5.

Nota: As of v12.5, the Fate Spirit will no longer recall any characters for you. It was found that romancible women were being duplicated. Even for a multiple romance mod, that's ridiculous. Also, since Horace provides ToB travel to SoA areas, similar problems could arise with other characters who are still available in and around Amn.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: Rjali's select/confirm sounds are all mixed up! And her name, too!
A: Select Rjali and press K key.

Q: Is there a romance between Rjali and a male PC?
A: That's the whole point of the mod, isn't it. In fact, Rjali won't even join you if your PC is female and/or evil.

Q: Is there anything I should know before playing this mod?
A: Well, you should be aware that there are 6 orphans to be collected in Athkatla for the orphanage project. Also, for group banters to occur, you must have at least 3 romanceable female NPCs in your party.

Q: Is Rjali compatible with mod X?
A: Rjali should work fine with other mods, although she only recognizes romances for the mods listed above. Install her after all other romance mods. This includes the (RJ) Eternal Imoen mod (plug).

Q: Who the hell is Horace?
A: Horace is the Djinn in the lamp. Show some respect!

Q: Why haven't you included combat in your quests?
A: Well, they are more projects than quests and, like Jini, I am more a lover than a fighter. Maybe as I get more proficient at this mod business, I'll retrofit some combat.

Q: What about more adult content?
A: Look. This is a ROMANCE mod. While there is sex, it is NOT the central focus. Get a life!

Q: What happened to Dream Doors?
A: I implemented it in the BGEE Jini mod. Just couldn't fit it into Rjali.

Q: How do I use Jini's Portal Stone?
A: In the inventory screen, right-click the stone and select CONVERSE. This also applies to Horace's lamp after you free him and he stops accepting rubs. And Morte's skull.

Q: When I use EEKeeper to change an NPC's portrait, some of your dialogues revert to the game portrait. Is this a bug?
A: No. You will also find that the epilogues revert to the game portrait, as well. To avoid this, do not use EEKeeper to change portraits. I know, it is convenient. To do the thing properly, you must move your portraits into the game OVERRIDE folder under the appropriate name.bmp. This will change the portrait wherever it is accessed in the game.

Q: More info on the ADVANCED AI scripts, please. What does the AGEN script do? How the heck do I manually change the script?
A: OK. YOU ASKED FOR IT! Rogues using the AAI scripts are almost permanently in search-for-traps mode. When such a character enters a dialogue as a third party, the script first drops them out of search-for-traps mode, which action prevents their interjection from occuring which stops the dialogue dead in its tracks. Any subsequent actions generated by that dialogue are lost which will lose some of the game and might even break it. The AGEN script is the basic fighter script: see enemy/get attacked = FIGHT! To manually change a script: select character; go up to the character screen; click CUSTOMIZE; click SCRIPT; you now have a list of the available scripts of which STANDARD ATTACK = AGEN. When I said "The game allows you to do this", I meant the GAME allows you to do this. If the equip option has been chosen, the ADVANCED AI option will give you the same as the STANDARD ATTACK option, and the original ADVANCED AI scripts will NOT be available for use. Without the equip option, you use the ADVANCED AI at your own risk. You have been warned and, as an advance on your expected experience: I TOLD YOU SO! (Yeah, yeah. I just found out that you can turn off the Search for Traps in the ADVANCED AI, so that is good. Still gonna do the switch with the equip option because it affects the openning scene dialogue in Chateau Irenicus, and you need to remember to turn it off before talking with Rjali for the first time.)

Q: How is the new expansion going to affect the Ascension and Redemption mods?
A: It shouldn't have any affect at all. Those two mods hook in on the finsol01.dlg file. My expansion hooks cut233i3.bcs, the final cutscene for a non-ascending protagonist, the calling of which is the final action of the game in finsol01.dlg. I take over after they are finished.

Q: What about starting a game in ToB?
A: You're on your own. I have never tested this because it makes no sense with the Rjali mod. She did not spring forth fully formed from the forehead of Zeus. The development in SoA is required for events in ToB. REQUIRED!

Q: Other than the listed NPC mods, what romances are available?
A: From BG2EE itself: Jaheira
                      Viconia
                      Aerie
                      Neera
                      Talira (NPNPC)

   From this mod:     Rjali
                      Annah
                      Grace
                      Ravel
                      Kesai-Serris (Ravel's daughter)
                      Jini   (NPNPC)
                      Fay    (Familiar)
                      Ecco   (sort of...)

Q: What about Hexxat?
A: No can do. Hexxat romances females only.

Q: Sometimes at the start of the game, the protagonist will not fight. What's with that?
A: Dunno why, but I find that, if I quick save and reload, he is back in fighting trim. The ways of the Infinity Engine are occasionally inscrutable.

Q: Why change Bodhi's selection of kidnappee?
A: Because it was based solely on install order of the relevant mods. I hated having to change the order of the mod installs or muck with party composition to get someone particular abducted. Now, you get to choose who. Alternatively, you can leave it to a truly random selection process which, under some conditions, may result in nobody getting taken. That would be the "lap of the gods". Oh, yes. The change will only allow Bodhi to abduct a female love interest, and not all of them are abductable. Never forgetting that Petsy will ALWAYS be abducted, in addition to whoever else gets taken.

Q: What will Horace do for me?
A: Teleport you to SoA areas in ToB
   Bring parked NPCs to join you (Cheat)
   Expedite/Unexpedite parking of your NPCs
   Supply you with Rjali's special equipment items (Cheat)
   Provide various services (Cheat)
     Increase Experience
     Increase HP
     Increase Strength
     Increase Dexterity
     Increase Constitution
     Increase Intelligence
     Increase Wisdom
     Increase Charisma
     Increase Gold
     Increase Reputation
   Worry enquiries
     Show you the status of your amours
     Tell you about logjams in love talks (Cheat)
     Give you the parkable status of party members (Cheat)
     Show Imoen's latest love meter standing in ToB
     Speedup some messengers (Cheat)
       Keep messenger
       Beeloo
       Danno
       Teo's messenger
       Spirit of the Grove
     Inform you of nice things you can do for party members (Cheat)
     Tell you the location of your parked women after he has stopped tracking your amours
     
Q: What is this parking thingy?
A: Well now. After you have acquired the de'Arnise Keep, you can drop romanced female party members from the party and ask them to wait for you at the Keep. They must have been scouted by Rjali and welcomed to the menage, before they can be parked. Sarileth and Ninde cannot be parked until ToB, because they have essential plot elements at the end of SoA. Yvette can NEVER be parked, 'cause she's special. Parked NPCs can be visited, invited back into the party, and even summoned by Horace from afar. Oh, yeah: Fay can be parked after you marry her. The object here was to allow the romancing of more than the five members that a party can hold. Well...six, counting Fay. And not counting Jini, Talira, and Ecco who do not join the party.

Flirting technology originally developed for Kelsey NPC by Jason Compton and
Jesse Meyers. http://www.pocketplane.net/kelsey

This mod was based on the Branwen NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II by Olga Silaeva. Rjali is not developed, supported, or endorsed by BioWare, Black Isle Studios, Interplay Entertainment Corp., or the Wizards of the Coast. All other trademarks and copyrights are property of their respective owners.

The Talira romance is based on the Chanelle Romantic Encounter by cmorgan.

The technique for copying a local variable for use in a global context was taken from the Power of Belief mod for PSTEE, by Aquadrizzt. (I did find that the BitSet action replaces the whole variable with the specified bit instead of doing a bitwise operation. Oh, well. The BitCheck works OK, so I could work around the limitation.)

- Force drop(unromanced)/park(romanced) InParty NPCs at start of expansion.

- Fix equip bug when NPC asked to join full party and immediately removed.
- Fix bug in Fade bug fix. It would seem that the WeiDU compiler converts InParty to IsValidForPartyDialogue. Who knew?
- Fix bug bottlenecking Ninde's love talks in the Underdark.

Version 8.3
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Accelerate banters along with other timings.
- Fix container fill problem in new areas. You can now save games in the new areas, except for the Modron Maze. Can't sleep perchance to dream though, as this could mess with the return mechanism.
- Remove most of the automatic transfers, necessitating the use of the Portal Stone and allowing more player control. Also ensures you can't leave the Portal Stone behind.
- Prevent interruption of Fay's 1st big chance, but allow raincheck.
- Add warning to not drop stuff in the Modron Maze.
- Remove abilities from engagement rings.
- Create weapons in inventory only, requiring you to manually equip them, which you have to do in any case in order for them to show up in the quick pick slots.
- Give Rjali the Cleric Heal spell, in addition to her Heal Party spell. Also, change icons for Heal Party to differentiate between it and Heal.
- Provide a dialogue option to switch Fay from run-away to follow, and back again. See spoiler above for rationale. She still won't fight, relying as she does on your ability to protect her.

Version 8.2
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Change default AI scripts using PARTYAI.2da instead of replacing scripts. You still lose access to the Advanced AI scripts. Still had to replace the BDDEFAI script because that is the hard-coded default for the PC. (Equip option only)
- Change color of RJBAG1 to differentiate it from RJBAG2.
- Change Rjali's Heal spell to Heal Party.
- Changes suggested by Seewead:
- Prevent Fay from fighting.
- Smooth out Adahn interaction, fixing bug where he addresses Jini when she isn't there.
- Populated Sigil containers.
- Portrait for large Fay when she is changed.
- Provided Fay selection sounds.
- Journal posts for quests added. (INFO only)
- Issue XP (not much, but some) on quest completion.
- Minor shift of options for Jini default party dialogue.
- Require circus quest before Rjali will proceed with you. Included in foreshadow in Chateau Irenicus. Rjali cuts you off until you do it.
- Fix Neera's repeating dialogue about the polymorph trap. (Yes, a bug report has been submitted to Beamdog.)

Version 8.1
- Fix install bug.

Version 8.0
- Requires a new game as there are changes that conflict with previous versions.
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Adjust dialogues to reflect BGEE Jini mod.
- Add Fay from BGEE Jini mod.
- Use proper animation for Trias.
- Skie can now be parked.
- Alter EXPEDITE for a slight delay. That instant continue was annoying to deal with.
- Add epilogues for non-party friends.
- Remove SaveGame from ports. They were saving games inside NO SAVE areas, which is pretty useless.
- Correct and expand Horace's status report.
- Improve dialogue protection from interruption.
- Automate the sequence of following Jini to meet Adahn.
- Patch bug in Petsy dialogue re Quest2.
- Replace all advanced AI scripts with AGEN when the equip option is selected.

Version 7.3
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Fix bug in 1st group talk. Only occurs when Jaheira and Neera have never been in the party, which screws up InActiveArea trigger as per IESDP documentation.
- Fix bug of Melissan failing to spawn on death of Gromnir. Caused by Bantergoose. Removed Bantergoose. Seems to have smoothed out some rough dialogue effects, as well.
- Fix bug in Moishe dialogues.
- New Nota.

Version 7.2
- Dialogue bug fixes.

Version 7.1
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Added brothal basement with an NPNPC from Jini prequel.
- New dialogue for continuity with BGEE Jini prequel mod. (Coming eventually)
- Figured out how to get text into an INFO TRIGGER region using WeiDU.
- Set up my own Bags of Holding. (I finally figured it out!)
- Deal with Player1 gender change.

Version 7.0
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Move scripts from baldur to Player1 and from baldur25 to Player1T. It turns out that changing Player1's OVERRIDE script is persisted after all, probably because Player1 doesn't have a pdialog.2da entry to be reset to. And the script runs whether party AI is on or off, which was the problem with using the Player1 default script. Attn modders: see my AR0602 and AR4000 scripts, and default.tpa.
- Dialogue option to decline to add PST women to your party, with ability to pick them up later (before chapter 4). You will only ever be able to pick up as many as there are empty slots in your party. This is distinct from parking.
- Parking only after being scouted, instead of simply being romanced. NPCs should be welcomed to the family before being dropped off at home.
- Horace facility to expedite NPCs in becoming parkable if speed-up component has been activated. This is for those players who want to stuff as many NPCs into the deArnise Keep as possible. Warning: until they reach parkability (when they have been scouted), the love talks come fast and furious. Nalia and Jaheira are still slow to reach romance due to required quests, with Nalia being by far the slower of the two.
- Remove option to NOT install multiple romance. This mod is all about multiple romance, and so much doesn't make sense if it is shut off. Also, cleaned up the tp2 a bit.
- Yves exchanges tales with each NPC. The only male NPCs who get in on the action are: Jan, Minsc, Rasaad, and Yoshimo. So far. And <CHARNAME>, of course.
- A few more interjections by the PST NPCs.
- Progressive PIDs with PST NPNPCs.
- Introduce romance music for Annah, Grace, And Ravel. (The music was there, but I forgot to use it!)
- A few tie-ins with the Jini BGEE mod. (teaser)
- A few more PST NPC banters.
- One last visit to the deArnise Keep before the final confrontation at the Throne of Bhaal. Goodbye dialogues, but no group banter. Return via the Pocket Plane Ability.
- Fix bug in transition to ToB for parked NPCs.

Version 6.2
- Minor dialogue, script, and continuity fixes.
- Cleaned up and expanded NPC introductions to Imoen in Spellhold. Also realized why nobody else is introduced to Imoen: the introductions are an artifact of the Imoen Romance. So, I rolled my own, which mod NPCs installed after Rjali can hook into quite easily. See Dialogue/SOA/RJBRAN/RJINTRO.d for a sample template. Of course, Rjali must be in the party for this to take effect, needing somewhere reliable to place the hook.
- Re-instated bantergoose, by request.

Version 6.1
- Minor dialogue, script, and continuity fixes.
- Fixed bug when Tyris mod installed.
- Fixed a bug when deArnise mod not installed.

Version 6.0
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Add banters, interjections, etc...
- I Dream of Jini. Another addition to the harem who just happens to be Horace's niece and who hangs out in Sigil. Expect to see some old friends from PST. Jini doesn't actually join the party, being a lover not a fighter. When and if I ever get around to doing something with Rjali in BGEE, we will run into Jini no doubt. Romances available for Annah, Grace, and Ravel from PST, if you were wondering why this took so long. Four brief quests have been added to roundup Adahn, Morte, Nordom, and Dakkon; they are not party joinable. Yet.
- Park romanced NPCs in the deArnise Keep to await your return. Romance remains active, allowing for more than 5 RomanceActive=2's. Include ability to swap in-party NPCs with stay-at-home NPCs. This applies only to BG2EE and PST romanceable NPCs; I didn't think it a good idea to muck with the complex story lines of the others. OK, I did Branwen: she's simple and my first. Oh, yeah: I also did Nalia and Imoen. But that's all, Folks! Release delayed another week or so to add chats with parked NPCs. Damn that muse!
- Fix the mise-en-scene of the SoA group banter to the 1st or 2nd floor of the deArnise Keep in order to include parked NPCs in the conversation and to remove any conflict with the Imoen romance.
- Introduce new NPCs to Imoen in Spellhold. Don't know why, but none of the other mods seem to do this.
- Epilogues for parked NPCs. And Jini and Horace, of course. And Nalia even if she hasn't achieved RomanceActive=2, because she is more or less permanently parked in the keep and is party to what goes on, willy-nilly. (Which is from an old English phrase: it will happen will-he/nil-he. Which is to say: whether he wants it or not.)
- Free Horace. This changes the lamp from "rub" to "converse". There is then always a 10% chance that he won't be there.
- Once you have been to Amkathra, Horace adds it to his list for teleporting.
- Annie and Billy are up to hanky-panky.
- Add a couple of orphans from Sigil via Jini at Ravel's suggestion.
- Use tpa's to rationalize the tp2 which was getting WAY too large. (On the recommendation of agb1)
- OGG the wav files to reduce the size of this thing.
- Start Rjali off screen instead of in the cage, to prevent conflict when EET comes out. I suspect they are gonna carry party members forward and place them in the available cages. And the game goes batshit crazy when characters overlap, which kinda makes you wonder why the MoveGlobalObject actually makes the moving character try to occupy the same space as the object. This is not so bad for fixed objects and global NPCs, but can really screw up non-global NPCs used as the object.
- Drop Rjali Sorcerer option. It makes no sense and complicates the install. There are always EEKeeper and Near Infinity, if you feel the need.
- Drop the ability to summon Rjali in ToB via the Fate Spirit. There is just too much in ToB that depends on Rjali having run through SoA. The whole orphanage project, just to name one thing. The same applies to Annah, Grace, and Ravel, although *they* can be parked in SoA and recovered in ToB, provided they have been romanced by the time they are parked; otherwise they get pissed at having been left alone so long and leave in a huff.
- Added Skie and Petsy to the romance options.
- Remove Bantergoose. Install it yourself if you so wish.

Version 5.2
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- No longer support Imoen Romance v2.
- Remove fixes for Imoen Romance (no longer needed).
- Fix bug in Fade multiple romance setup.

Version 5.1
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Accommodate WeiDU changes.
- Accommodate BWS.

Version 5
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Fixed bug in spell that sets up Neera's portrait.
- Slight change to Rjali's memorized priest spells. (multi-class Cleric/Thief only)
- Reduced the delay on Horace's roster status reports and on group banter initialization to a minimum. There is still a slight delay that varies with your current harem count. Tough.
- Fixed the delay problem when Rjali equips NPCs. You still need to lift/drop the axe and the sword into their slots on the inventory screen before they appear on the main screen character menu at the bottom of the screen. Seems BG2EE doesn't quite co-ordinate putting weapons into slots via dialogue/script with this display. Oh yeah. Rjali now gets off her duff and hustles over to the new party member in order to give them the goods.
- Added Dace, Isra, and Amber to the mix. (At the suggestion of Ser Elryk))
- Eliminated all external patchs to other mods.
- Reorganized and modularized to facilitate addition of future NPCs.
- Imoen Romance v3 accomodated. (Eternal Imoen is now compatible with this.) ('nother plug)
- Added "Can Use Any Item" to the character buffs provided by Rjali's Book.
- Added Dump/UnDump to round out off-again/on-again romances.

Version 4.1
- Minor dialogue and script fixes.
- Fixed nasty bug in group banter scripts, introduced in v4.
- Stopped equiping Yoshimo. It made him too dangerous in Spellhold.
- Let Horace provide equipment at any time, just in case.
- Fix Viconia's timing speedup.
- Add Imoen Romance v2.4/v2.5 patch for 1st dialogue in Brynlaw.
- Make the Genie Lamp a party item that will be returned if the holder leaves the party.
- Add Genie knudges for the playhouse, mage apprentice, and spirit of the grove plots. No knudge will be necessary for the ranger and paladin plots.

Version 4
- Minor dialogue fixes.
- Re-instated the name and sound fix hotkey. (said he, sheepishly)
- Changes to equiping the crew. Equipment is now placed in appropriate slots, and the sword is equipped. Also, if Rjali is with you and equiping joining NPCs when you get Imoen back, AND you have already sold off Imoen's original equipment, (*inhale*) Rjali will re-equip Imoen. Two notes here: the equipment takes a little time to load, so be patient; the sword and axe will not show at the base of your screen when you select a character until you manually click each in the character profile.
- If you switch sex or turn evil, Rjali leaves. Immediately. Permanently.
- Add a genie lamp which can be found on a table in Chateau Irenicus. You place the lamp into one of the quick item slots and click it. A genie appears, and you talk to him. The genie provides a variety of services a la RJMadLum mod for all party members and, in TOB, will provide transportation a la RJTourist mod to the PC (only). If you have not installed the equip option or if Rjali is not in the party, he will give you access to Rjali's items.
  I had to add him in the Rjali mod because he turns out to have plot implications and non-click dialogues with the PC and Rjali. If you refuse Rjali or she refuses you, the genie lamp remains in the game with only the first dialogue with your PC.
  Oh, yeah. He will knudge you when it is time to check in at the deArnise Keep. I keep missing the tax reminders and, besides, the reminder is NOT in sync with the keep plot.
- Extend orphan dialogues to get rid of the "has nothing to say to you".
- Add Tashia, Ninde, Yvette, Fade, and Tyris to the mix, including dummy dialogue capability.  Provide patches for bugs and multiple romance capability.
- Remove BG2EE Jaheira fix. (Bad idea in the 1st place. Loop was only annoying.)
- Make multiple romance optional. (Without it, you're going to lose content.) If you keep Rjali and she you, and you have not installed the multiple romance option, multiple romances may still occur because other NPCs just don't know about Rjali, and not even necessarily about each other. However, without multiple romance, you will not get the co-ordination dialogues but you can still get the group banters. Added a dump process if you romance an NPC and subsequently become uncoupled. Also, Rjali will not accept romances with men and Hexxat.
- Option for Rjali to be a sorcerer.
- Option for dialogue speed-up. Settings:
   - Do not install; leave romance dialogues at original timings. (recommended for 1st time players, who will likely get through chapter 3 in about 120 game days)
   - 1 = not much different from not install; a touch faster. (recommended for those who typically get through chapter 3 in 100 game days)
   - 2 = a little faster. (recommended for those who get through chapter 3 in 80-90 game days)
   - 3 = a lot faster; recommended for most romances. This is where I play. (recommended for players who get through chapter 3 in about 60 game days)
- Add facility to maintain a roster of invisible cats mirroring romantic partners. These are used as variables in group dialogues to reduce selection logic and remove NPC dependencies.
- Speed up Aerie's marriage and birthing. I mean, I know it can't be 9 monthes, but the timer settings are still ridiculously long. Raise your hand if you haven't seen Aerie's baby...

Version 3
- Redo all of Rjali's dialogues.
- The Orphanage Project. Not a quest exactly...
- Add multiple romance co-ordination dialogues.
- Introduce group banter. (Things happen when you romance more than one woman and they KNOW. And women ALWAYS know.)
- TRAify the dialogs. (English only, at the moment.)
- Add journal entries. (INFO NOT QUEST)
- Make the Saerileth Romance Mod multi-romance capable. (if it is installed)
- Make the Branwen Romance Mod multi-romance capable. (if it is installed)
- Make the Nalia Romance Mod multi-romance capable, and stop her being so fussy about you being a fighter. (if it is installed)
- Add dummy dialogue files for Saerileth and Branwen if they are not installed, to allow CHAIN dialog for these NPCs triggered by InParty, without having to go all Weidu. This is why NPC mods MUST be installed before Rjali: to prevent the installation of these dummy dialog files.
- Added an Imoen romance epilogue, which I will remove if/when v3 ever comes out (if it is installed).
- Add an install option to speed up dialogues for experienced players who move so fast they miss some dialogue.
- Fix tweakpack multiple-stronghold bug where the cleric is not spawned (if it is installed).
- Fix tweakpack multiple-romance bug in TOB wraith sequence.
- Fix BG2EE Jaheira final romance dialogue loop. (Have to keep an eye on this one...)


Version 2
- Rjali refuses to be unloved. RjaliRomanceActive=2, and that's that.
- Now compatible with the Eternal Imoen mod. (That's mine, too!)
- Add a wedding ring and a diamond to give to Rjali.
- Added an install option to make Rjali a source of extreme goodies for joining NPCs: standard BG2EE NPCs, Branwen, and Saerileth. She does not, however, equip Wilson. If you prefer to retain the original difficulty, do not select this option. With this equipment (usable by ANY character type), you and yours are virtually unkillable. Where she is hiding these items is one of the great mysteries of the universe. As Rjali says: "A girl has to have SOME secrets!"
  One of the items is a self-improvement book which, when used, confers on the user several attributes pretty much on a par with KILLSW01. I mean to say: REALLY BIG TIME cheats. Use this book only if you want you and your companions to be god-like. (I, personally, am allergic to dying. I like the story...and killing things.)
  She also returns PC's wallet (containing 10000 GP) which she had lifted just prior to being captured by Irenicus.
  She ALSO hands out bags of holding: a RJBAG1 and a RJBAG2 to each party member up to a limit of 6. Or 5 if Saerileth is installed; Saerileth reacts VERY negatively to evil items, and the bags will on occasion hold evil items. One bag type (say RJBAG1) should be used to hold items for sale; the other for items to be retained. The interesting thing is that an item placed into one character's bag is instantly available to every other character holding the same bag#. Very useful. Macroscopic QM Spooky Action at a Distance. Oh yes. You should install the Tweakpack Bottomless Bags of Holding to complete the cheat.
  Spell slots are maximized for all classes for all levels.

Version 1
- Initial release BG2EE compatible only.
- Made Rjali undropable. Gonna have to kill her off or zap her with CLUA. Or go along for the ride! Basicly, you gotta love her 'til she dies, and you are a pair from the git-go. While she refuses to leave and eternally wants you, she reserves the right to heckle. Sound familiar much?
- Rjali is multiple romance with a vengence. She knows about the others. And she discusses it with them! You are living in interesting times!

4) Creating and Using a Creature in a Chain Dialogue
5) Creating a Creature in a Script
6) Dialogue Stubs
7) Globally Accessing Local Variables

------------------------------------------------------------------
1) StartCutSceneMode in Dialogues
------------------------------------------------------------------

StartCutSceneMode() should only be used in a dialogue in a final response when terminated by EXIT. If it is necessary to continue the dialogue beyond that point, use a separate script cutscene instead of inline, and let the script set a variable and start a dialogue conditioned on that variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Below-the-Line Responses in Chain Dialogues
------------------------------------------------------------------

Below-the-line responses in a Chain dialogue occur in the last dialogue file that actually happens. Thus, the creature and dialogue file owning these responses is a runtime variable. Be sure that any actions in these responses that predicate an active creature are embedded in an ActionOverride.

This showed up with Fade's interjection in the conversation with the dying apprentice to the schloob caught in Mad Lum's machine. Because Fade's comment was last in the dialogue before the final response, she died instead of the apprentice. I appended a comment by the apprentice to ensure HE was the one to die.

------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Player1 Dialogues
------------------------------------------------------------------

In a normal dialogue block, Player1 responses are assumed and present no unusual problems. However, if you want to use the PLAYER1 dialogue file, there are considerations.

You can always StartDialogue("Player1",Player1) from a script, but if you wish to hive off to PLAYER1 dialogue from a running dialogue you must ActionOverride(Player1,SetDialog("PLAYER1")) in at least two dialogue blocks before issuing the EXTERN PLAYER1 *name*. This is because you cannot rely on PLAYER1 being the Player1 dialogue file.

You might want to do this so that Player1 can muse to himself, or you might want to use Player1 in a Chain dialogue.

------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Creating and Using a Creature in a Chain Dialogue
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you CreateCreature in Chain dialogue, you must let one more dialogue line occur before using that creature in the dialogue to ensure that it is available.

------------------------------------------------------------------
5) Creating a Creature in a Script
------------------------------------------------------------------

After CreateCreature you must Wait(1) before MakeGlobal() and Wait(1) again before moving the creature off somewhere else. I have been too lazy to experiment with the Wait interval, so it might take less.

------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Dialogue Stubs
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to establish a fixed entry point in one of your own dialogue files, you can start the file with one or more stubs, each with its own number, of course. Such as:

BEGIN DIALOG

IF ~False()~ THEN BEGIN 0 // proposed use
SAY @0
IF ~~ THEN EXIT
END

IF ~False()~ THEN BEGIN 1 // proposed use
SAY @0
IF ~~ THEN EXIT
END

You can then in some dialogue file:

REPLACE DIALOG

IF ~~ 0
SAY @999
IF ~~ THEN REPLY @999 DO ~whatever~ GOTO whereever
END

END

This allows you to EXTERN DIALOG 0 from anywhere. It also gives you a fixed position to add to the responses:

EXTEND_BOTTOM DIALOG 0
IF ~conditions~ THEN REPLY @999 DO ~whatever~ GOTO whereever
END

------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Globally Accessing Local Variables
------------------------------------------------------------------

Local variables are designed to be accessed only by the owner of the locality. This can be very restricting, but there is a technique to extract a local to a global variable. For an example, see: Rjali\Scripts\SOA\RJAERI\RJLOCSOA.baf. This script is designed to extract Aerie's LoveTalk counter to a Global for use elsewhere. The RJAELoc variable is the trigger to initiate the routine. The RJAELoc1 is the Global, which must be preset to 0, presumeably when the trigger is set. IncrementGlobal is used because the BitSet action behaves like SetGlobal, which is not what it should do.
